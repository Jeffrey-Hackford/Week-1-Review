                <ul>
                  <li>At the start of the week my pair and I created a basic HTML page using common tags such as h, ul, p, li, and many others. We created a few webpages including <a href="https://github.com/Jeffrey-Hackford/my_first_webpage">"My first webpage".</a></li>
                    <hr>
                  <li>Later we practiced basic using CSS and HTML together and learned how seperate style sheets are important for organized programming, as well as created our first README. Examples of our work on CSS can be found <a href="https://github.com/Jeffrey-Hackford/my_first_webpage/blob/master/README.md">here.</a></li>
                    <hr>
                  <li>On Thursday we were introduced to Bootstrap and spent some time using it to reproduce the Wikipedia Home page. We ran out of time but the combonation of Bootstrap's CSS and our HTML/CSS allowed us to produce a very convincing partial copy. <a href="https://github.com/Jeffrey-Hackford/wiki">Our Wiki Page</a></li>

            <h3>About Me</h3>

                <li><strong>Education</strong></li>
                  <p>I attended high school at Palo Verde in Las Vegas, NV. It was there that I elected to take a computer graphics and animation class my freshmen year, and the advanced class my sophmore year. I struggled with some of the graphic designs but I enjoyed the class as a whole enough to look into a career path that involved similar elements, such as coding.</p>
                  <p>I was unable to take any coding classes during my enrollment at The College of Southern Nevada but my interest did not fade. I began teaching myself in whatever downtime I had between other classes and homework.</p>
                    <hr>
                <li><strong>Work Experience</strong></li>
                  <p>After college I held a series of odd jobs while trying to save money. Eventually I was offered a temporary position at SendOutCards. This went very well and they invited me to stay on full time. I worked there for a year and a half and only left because the opportunity to advance my education presented itself.</p>
                    <hr>
                <li><strong>Epicodus</strong></li>
                  <p>I first heard of coding bootcamps and academys from my older brother who had several friends attend with positive results. I immediately begun research on which school would be best for me. I considered courses offered, location, reputation, and several other factors important to me. I eventually found and fell in love with Epicodus!</p>

                <li><strong>Interests and Hobbies</strong></li>
                  <p>Some of my interests include:

                      <li>1</li>
                      <li>2</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

              </ul>
